# Password-locks
built in 2024.12.19ï¼Œ

This 8-digit combination lock is based on the IAP15F2K61S2 chip, which has the function of deleting characters, modifying the password, and the function of changing the password will not be lost when the power is off.

There is still a problem with this program: the motor won't turn off once it's turned on, and today(2024.12.23) I spent an afternoon trying to fix it, but it failed.fuuuuuuuuuuuuuuuuuuuuuuuuuuuuuuuuuuuuuuuuuuuuuuuuuck.
